# 🎥 Video Screenshot Extractor

A simple Python GUI tool (Tkinter + OpenCV) to extract screenshots from videos.  
It automatically saves the **first**, **middle**, and **last** frame from each `.mp4` video.

# 👉 Steps 
When you click Start Processing, it asks you to select the input folder first.

Then it asks you to select the output folder.

Inside the output folder, it re-creates the same folder structure as input.
